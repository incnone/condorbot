Condorbot TODO

- Throw warning if race scheduled after deadline
- Read league from GSheet and update match_data
- `.unconfirm` during the 30 mins before a race doesn't delete the race room
- Some race completion times in the database are still incorrect
- Room topics do not update during races
- Race doesn't give the 30 minute warning
- Get rid of `.here` and associated notifications
- `.forcenewrace` is intermittently broken
- Fix the "next friday" check to be independent of the computer's local timezone
- Add `-language` to `.cawmentate` command, and allow users to set a default
- Add `curl` events to race start/end to auto-record bots, like Mac asks
- Put stream links in <> so as to disable previews
