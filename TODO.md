# Bot bugs

- Room topics do not update during races
- Race doesn't give the 30 minute warning

- `.forcenewrace` is intermittently broken (?)

# Bot features

- Add bot reminders for unscheduled matches later in week, or unconfirmed
- Add `-language` to `.cawmentate` command, and allow users to set a default
