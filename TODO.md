Condorbot TODO

# Bot bugs

- Room topics do not update during races
- Race doesn't give the 30 minute warning
- Fix the "next friday" check to be independent of the computer's local timezone
- `.forcenewrace` is intermittently broken (?)

# Bot features

- ~~Send message in #season5 when a race completes with the score~~
- Make the person who suggests a time automatically confirm it
- Add `-language` to `.cawmentate` command, and allow users to set a default
- Add `curl` events to race start/end to auto-record bots, like Mac asks

# Database bugs

- Some race completion times in the database are still incorrect
